### Questions
If you have any, you can post a question in the issues, but I can't promise I'll respond immediately. Help others and they will help you.
Building a community of users is always the best way to solve each-others problems!

### Bugs, Problems and Feature-Requests
If you really want to open a new issue:
* Please use the [search functionality](//github.com/yotamberk/timeline-plus/issues) to make sure that there is not already an issue concerning the same topic.
* Note that development happens on the `develop` git branch. Be sure to submit PRs against this branch.
* If you think you found a bug please **provide a simple example** (e.g. on [jsbin](jsbin.com)) that demonstrates the problem.
* If you want to propose a feature-request please **describe what you are looking for in detail**, ideally providing a screenshot, drawing or something similar.
* **Close the issue later**, when the issue is no longer needed.
